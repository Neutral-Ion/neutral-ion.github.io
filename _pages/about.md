Hercule Poirot once observed that small boys tend to love trains, tying it to an "undeveloped mind". While my mind has (hopefully) developed in the recent years, that early fascination of trains has remained. If anything, that interest has grown to encompass the systems behind the locomotives: the politics, the economics, the bureacracy. Behind all these buildings, there is a story, and I hope to uncover it with you.

NJTransit’s Arrow cars are, I feel, incredible underappreciated. Yes, they’re old (44 years), prone to breakdowns, and lack the electronic signage of the newer trains.

But the Arrow cars have character. They’re self-propelled – and self-propelled trains are honestly just much cooler than any locomotive-pulled train (what’s pulling it??!). Long Island Railroad and Metro-North cars end up looking like a bigger version of a subway, which the Arrows avoid with their distinct ribbed stainless steel exteriors. They’re something that evokes commuter rail. And despite its commuter purpose, the Arrow cars are standing-friendly. With handles on every seat, and plenty of open space in the middle of the car, if I had to pick any train to be packed into and stand in for 45 minutes, it would be the Arrows. When riding NJTransit, there will always be a time when there are no seats available – would you want to be crammed into the tight aisles of a Comet or stand with pride in the center-door vestibule?

Plus the age of the Arrow cars has its own perks. They aren’t as rickety as the ugly Comets, but you can *feel* the electrical motors humming when the train accelerates, each vibration reminding you that *yes, you are inside a steel shell hurtling at 90 miles per hour*, and *yes, that is awesome*. Couple that with the iconic, nearly nostalgic horn, and this is the consummate train experience. The newer Multilevels are just too bland, too polished to inspire this degree of feeling.

The Arrows just have far more character than the soulless blue interiors of the “Squarebob” Multilevels. I mean, look at it. When I see the faux wood paneling and brown faux leather seats, I know I’m in NJTransit. And when I'm waking up bleary-eyed to catch the 6:42am train, the one thing I'm looking forward to is the class Arrow to fly through the snowy landscape, as the sun begins to rise on Jersey.

Sometimes, I pass by a scrapyard in Avenel, where some days I can see retired Arrows. The NJTransit logo emblazoned on the front of the cars waves at me, amidst the metal shreds surrounding the doomed cars. I watch the retired trains till they leave my sight, as I’m whisked away by their replacements.
